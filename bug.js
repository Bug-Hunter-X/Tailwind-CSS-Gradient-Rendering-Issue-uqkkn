```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-lg">
  <!-- Your content here -->
</div>
```
This code snippet uses Tailwind CSS's gradient functionality. However, if the `to-purple-500` class is not defined in your Tailwind CSS configuration file (or if there's a typo), it will not render correctly. This might cause unexpected visual issues or the gradient to appear incorrect.
